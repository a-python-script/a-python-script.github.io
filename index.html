          <p align="justify">Motivated by the progressive dumbing down of people by superstition, conspiracy theories and machinations
            of politics, I have made it my goal to make this blog the bright spot of humanity. Clear, scientific
            presentation and reappraisal of hot topics and everything I just feel like. The attentive reader may
            already have noticed that English is not my native language, he may forgive me. I try to keep this blog
            international. For texts in English I let myself be supported by the translator <a
              href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a>. For texts in German my wife has to serve.

            This page is still a blank slate but soon it will shine in a bright light and enlighten all those who do
            not want to escape the truth and want to go deeper down the rabbit hole.

            To those who wonder who I am: I am a 30-year-old average citizen from Germany with a high school diploma,
            an apprenticeship as an automotive mechatronics technician, a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering
            and possibly soon a master's degree in computer science. Data, Deep Learning and 3D applications are my
            great passion.</p>
