<p>"That's one small step for me, one giant leap for mankind."</p>

<p>Motivated by the progressive dumbing down of people by superstition, conspiracy theories and machinations of politics, I have made it my goal to make this blog the bright spot of humanity. Clear, scientific presentation and reappraisal of hot topics and everything I just feel like. The attentive reader may already have noticed that English is not my native language, he may forgive me. I try to keep this blog international. For texts in English I let myself be supported by the translator <a href="https://www.deepl.com/translator">DeepL</a>. For texts in German my wife has to serve.</p>
<p>This page is still a blank slate but soon it will shine in a bright light and enlighten all those who do not want to escape the truth and want to go deeper down the rabbit hole.</p>
<p>To those who wonder who I am: I am a 30-year-old average citizen from Germany with a high school diploma, an apprenticeship as an automotive mechatronics technician, a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering and possibly soon a master's degree in computer science. Data, deep learning and 3D applications are my great passion.</p>
